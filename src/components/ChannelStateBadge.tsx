 * uppercase turned `Standby` into `STANDBY`.
 *
 * Lives in the channel row's *header*, beside the channel name, never in the
 * tile row: the reference app floats it over the card's top-left corner for
 * the same reason, and our tile rows have a fixed width budget (see
 * `OUTPUT_ROW_MAX_WIDTH`) that an extra item wraps.
 *
 * `null` means genuinely unknown — no telemetry yet, a channel past the end of
 * the packet's state array, or a firmware family with no state table — and
 * renders as a dash rather than defaulting to "Normal". `raw` is the wire value
 * it decoded from, shown in the tooltip so a surprising `Unknown` can be traced
