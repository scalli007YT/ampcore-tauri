/** Input clip indicator — the heartbeat's `InStates` byte, whose vendor enum
 * is `InputChState { Clip = 0, None = 1 }`. Deliberately not a
 * `ChannelStateBadge`: inputs have no operating state, only this one flag, and
 * conflating the two is exactly the mistake this replaced.
 *
 * Renders nothing unless the input is actually clipping, matching how the
 * output state pill only appears when there is something to say. `null` (no
 * reading, or a byte outside the known set) also renders nothing rather than
 * claiming the input is clean.
 *
 * NOTE: the polarity here follows the vendor, which is not yet confirmed on
 * hardware — the prior web implementation reads the same `0` as "signal
 * present". See `Telemetry::input_clipping`. */
