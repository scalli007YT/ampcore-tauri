 * `useLivePresets` already reports FC=59 failures.
 *

 * resolves with `{ status: "error" }` for an `AppError` rather than
 * rejecting — `AppError` is a plain `{ message }` struct, not an `Error`
 * instance, so it never hits the `throw` branch in `typedError`. A
 * `.catch()` on these calls is therefore dead code: it was silently
 * dropping every backend-side failure (unknown firmware family, device no
 * longer in discovery, unparseable ip, "no FC=27 poll yet to merge this EQ
 * band against"), leaving the user with a control that just snapped back on
 * the next poll and no explanation. This checks `status` instead.
 *
 * Failures deliberately carry **no `id`**, so they stack, and
 * `autoClose: false`, so they persist until dismissed. A failed write means
 * the device did not take the value — losing that behind a newer toast is
 * the one outcome that must not happen silently. `<Notifications limit>` in
 * `main.tsx` caps how many pile up.
 *
 * The burst protection that the old `id` provided now lives where it belongs:
 * `notifySuccess` stays silent for coalesced writes, and the backend collapses
 * repeated writes to one parameter before they ever reach the wire (see
 * `WriteRegistry::submit`), so a drag no longer generates a toast per
 * intermediate value in the first place. */
