/** Every mutation `AmpConfigureView`'s tabs (and `EqEditor`/`LimiterEditor`)
 * can make, abstracted away from *how* — Project mode persists to a
 * `Project` file via `commands.projectsSetX`, Direct Edit mode writes
 * straight to a live device via `commands.liveControlSetX` (see
 * `liveConfigureAdapter.ts`). Optional members mean "not available for this
 * source", signalled by plain `undefined` — call sites early-return on it.
 *
 * Every member resolves with an `ActionResult` and never rejects, so a
 * caller can react to the outcome (e.g. a tile's `visualValidation`) without
 * try/catch. Callers that don't care can keep ignoring the return value.
 *
 * As of the 1.1.8 Tier-A pass the only member Direct Edit mode still leaves
 * undefined is `setChannelOhms` — a Project-only concept, gated by
 * `ConfigureCapabilities.ohmsEditable` so it explains itself rather than
 * sitting inert. Every other member has a live wire command; FIR is the one
 * remaining device feature with no action here at all, and its tab says so
 * explicitly instead of offering dead controls.
 *
 * Note that an early-return on `undefined` is silent by design *only* where
 * a capability flag already explains the absence. Adding a new optional
 * member without that gating reintroduces a control that looks live and
 * does nothing. */
