 * converter (`fromat_machineState_color.cs`) on temp, which the vendor paints
 * orange — the reference wins, since that is the app these amps were run from.
 *
 * The reference renders *no pill at all* for the remaining five, which leaves
 * real fault conditions invisible. Those are filled in here instead: overload
 * takes the vendor converter's orange, dcp and powerError take red on
 * severity, limit takes yellow to match the row's own LIM tile accent, and
