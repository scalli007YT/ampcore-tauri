import { useMediaQuery } from "@mantine/hooks";

/** App-wide layout breakpoints. Deliberately *window*-relative (media
 * queries), not element-relative: every consumer is reacting to "the whole
 * app window got small" — a restored-down desktop window, a snapped half
 * screen, or a tablet — rather than to its own box shrinking.
 *
 * `compact` is the main one: below it, side rails collapse into inline
 * pickers and multi-pane pages stack vertically. `tight` is the second
 * step, for layouts that still don't fit once stacked (phone-ish widths and
 * the modals that go full-screen there). `short` covers vertical squeeze —
 * a wide-but-short window still needs scrolling panes rather than
 * vertically-centered ones.
 *
 * `useMediaQuery` returns `undefined` on the very first render (before the
 * listener attaches); every hook here coerces that to `false` so the
 * desktop layout is what renders first and narrow layouts only ever appear
 * after a real match — never a flash of the wrong one at full size. */
