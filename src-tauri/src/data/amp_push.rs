//! Online ← offline push: turns the difference between a project amp and its
//! linked network amp into an ordered list of writes, so the *amp* adopts the
//! plan. The mirror image of `amp_merge.rs`, which copies the other way.
//!
//! The two directions are not symmetric. A pull is one atomic FC=27 read; a
//! push is N sequential ACK'd UDP writes against hardware that cannot roll
//! back. So this module plans rather than acts: it produces a `PushPlan` of
//! labelled stages up front, the caller executes them in order and stops at
//! the first failure, and a partly-applied push is resolved by planning again
//! — the next plan simply contains whatever is still different.
//!
//! **Diffing is the hash's diffing.** Every comparison runs through
//! `fingerprint.rs`'s `round_to_step` with the same `*_STEPS` constants, and
//! skips exactly what the hash skips: a band bypassed on both sides, a
//! disabled limiter stage, an inactive crosspoint's gain, a gain/Q the filter
//! type doesn't use. Anything else would plan writes that cannot change
//! whether the two fingerprints match — the only definition of "done" this
//! feature has (see `edit_lock.rs`).
//!
//! **Three fields are read-only by decision, not by protocol**: `ohms`,
//! `limiter.rms.max_vrms` and `limiter.peak.max_vp`. The vendor can write the
//! first (FC=72) and carries the other two in its 13-byte FC=54/55 records,
//! but all three describe what the hardware *is* — its load and its rated
//! output voltage — rather than what anyone plans for it. They are hashed, so
//! a push that left them differing could never converge; instead
//! `adopt_device_facts` copies them the other way as part of the same
//! transaction, and `PushPlan.adopted` lists them so the swap is visible
//! rather than silent.
