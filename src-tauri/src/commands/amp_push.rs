//! Online ← offline push commands: plan the writes that make a linked network
//! amp adopt its project amp's settings, then execute them in order.
//!
//! The counterpart to `amp_links.rs::projects_merge_amp_from_live`, and it
//! borrows that command's guard sequence verbatim — a push and a pull are
//! valid under exactly the same preconditions. What differs is the ending: a
//! pull is one all-or-nothing in-memory swap, while a push leaves real
//! hardware partly configured if it fails halfway. That is why it stops at the
//! first failed write and reports which stage, rather than pretending to be a
//! transaction: planning again resumes from whatever is still different.
//!
//! See `data/amp_push.rs` for what is planned, in what order, and why three
//! device-determined fields flow the other way instead.
