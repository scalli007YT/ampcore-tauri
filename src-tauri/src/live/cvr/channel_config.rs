//! Shared channel-config adapter surface — the struct every firmware-specific
//! FC=27 (SYNC_DATA) adapter parses a reassembled response into, plus the
//! single dispatch point that picks which adapter handles a device based on
//! its `firmware_family` (same pattern as `telemetry.rs`).
//!
//! Deliberately separate from `AmpChannel` (`data/project.rs`): that struct
//! carries planning-only fields (`id`, `ohms`) with no live-wire equivalent — the same separation already
//! established between `Telemetry` and `AmpChannel`.
