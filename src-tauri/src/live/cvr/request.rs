//! General-purpose UDP request/response primitive for the CVR protocol:
//! inbound multi-fragment reassembly, a pending-request registry with
//! per-request correlation, and settle-timer + hard-timeout + retry
//! mechanics. Built for FC=27 (SYNC_DATA)'s bulk multi-frame response, but
//! deliberately not FC=27-specific — any future one-shot request/response
//! FC degenerates to the same primitive (one frame arrives, the settle timer
//! elapses with no follow-up, it resolves).
//!
//! The reference implementation has the same frames+settle-timer shape but
//! keys pending requests only by `(ip, function_code)` with no per-request
//! correlation — a stale reply from an already-timed-out request can be
//! misattributed to a newer request for the same key. This module fixes
//! that with a monotonic generation counter per key (see `RequestRegistry`).
//!
//! The second half of this file is the *write* counterpart, `WriteRegistry`
//! — a separate, much simpler engine built on the protocol's transport-level
//! ACK (`NetworkDataHeader.data_state`) rather than on function-code replies.
//! The two are independent: a request correlates a full response frame by
//! `(ip, function_code)`, whereas a write only ever gets back a bare 10-byte
//! header carrying no identifying field at all, so it correlates by device IP
//! under strict stop-and-wait. See `WriteRegistry::on_ack`.
