// cost is a broadcast query and one tiny reply per amp per second, and
// `LiveEventSink::upsert` only emits when something actually changed, so an
// amp that simply keeps answering costs the UI nothing.

/// hardware, chosen so a write (e.g. `live_control_set_output_mute`) is

/// Worth knowing when tuning this: the C# vendor app does **not** poll FC=27
/// on a timer at all. It syncs once on entering a device (`UDP.intoCW`) and

/// needed to be there.

/// device has been reported it refreshes one pair per `BRIDGE_STEADY_INTERVAL`
/// — far slower than the config tick. Until then the tick primes at
/// `BRIDGE_PRIME_INTERVAL`, so a freshly subscribed amp learns both pairs in a
/// few hundred ms rather than seconds: a project amp's fingerprint (hence its
